## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/horse-race-prediction.git
   cd horse-race-prediction
   python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
Prepare the data by following the instructions in the Data section.

Run the preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the data:
python preprocess.py
python train.py
python predict.py --input new_data.csv --output predictions.csv
## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of historical horse race data from 1990 to 2020, including information on horses, jockeys, trainers, race conditions, and results. You can obtain the data from [source] or use your own dataset. Place the data files in the data directory.
## Model
The model is built using [specify the machine learning framework, e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch]. It involves the following steps:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.
Feature engineering: Creating new features that might improve model performance.
Model training: Training various machine learning models and selecting the best one based on evaluation metrics.
Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing the model parameters for better performance.
## Results
The results of the model are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the notebooks directory.
